Project Description:

The aim of this project was to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the New York City (NYC) Taxi Trip dataset to extract valuable insights regarding fare amounts and payment types. The dataset used in this analysis contains a vast amount of information regarding taxi trips, including fare amounts, payment methods, trip durations, and various other attributes.

Methodology:

Data Cleaning:
The first step involved thorough data cleaning to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies within the dataset. Cleaning procedures included handling null values, correcting data types, and removing duplicates.

Descriptive Analysis:
Descriptive statistics were employed to summarize key aspects of the data. This involved computing measures such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and percentiles for fare amounts. Additionally, distributions and frequencies of payment types were analyzed.

Statistical Analysis:
Statistical analysis was conducted to delve deeper into the relationship between fare amounts and payment types. Hypothesis testing was performed using a T-test to evaluate whether different payment methods significantly influence fare amounts. The null hypothesis assumed no significant difference in fare amounts between different payment methods.

Visualization:
Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn were utilized for data visualization. Various plots, including histograms, box plots, and scatter plots, were created to visually represent the distribution of fare amounts, explore the relationship between fare amounts and payment types, and illustrate any patterns or trends within the data.

Tools and Libraries:

Python: Utilized as the primary programming language.
Pandas: Employed for data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: Used for data visualization.
Scipy and Statsmodels: Utilized for statistical analysis and hypothesis testing.
Conclusion:

Through this project, valuable insights were gained regarding fare amounts and payment types within the NYC Taxi Trip dataset. The statistical analysis provided evidence of a potential relationship between payment methods and fare amounts, highlighting the importance of considering payment type when predicting taxi fares. This project not only demonstrated proficiency in data analysis techniques but also showcased the utility of Python and its libraries for conducting in-depth exploratory data analysis.
